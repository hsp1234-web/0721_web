# Phoenix Heart - Unified E2E Test Script
#
# This script is the single entry point for running all tests, including E2E tests.
#
# Flow:
# 1. Ensure our shell exits immediately on any error.
# 2. Find the project root directory.
# 3. Call the smart launcher `launch.py` in `--prepare-only` mode to
#    create the virtual environment and install all dependencies.
# 4. Start the services in the background.
# 5. Run the E2E test script.
# 6. Stop the services.
# 7. Run Pytest for unit/integration tests.
#

# Exit immediately on any error
set -e

# Get the script's directory and find the project root
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")
PROJECT_ROOT="$SCRIPT_DIR/.."
